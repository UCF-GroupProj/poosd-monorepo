### Web Dev Setup:
1. Ensure pnpm is installed, otherwise run `npm install -g pnpm`
2. Install Packages in the root directory: `pnpm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server

### Web Dev Options:
1. `npm run dev` - spins up both nextjs and express server for development purpose
2. `npm run build` - Build the application for production purpose
3. `npm run lint` - Check if codes are within the styling guidelines


### Mobile Dev
Good thing is that you can ignore all the instructions above, unless you're a web dev too.

Your code is isolated/independent from other monorepo apps, so any changes you made to mobile will only stay there.
